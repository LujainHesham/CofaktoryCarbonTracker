# CofaktoryCarbonTracker
The Carbon Footprint Tracker project aims to develop an information system for Cofaktory, a non-existing company with five branches in Egypt, to help industries measure, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint. The system will track greenhouse gas emissions, identify areas for improvement, and support strategies to lower environmental impact, contributing to global climate goals.
