# CofaktoryCarbonTracker
Cofakortory Carbon Emissions Monitoring System üåç‚òï
A fictional information system for tracking and reducing carbon emissions across 5 coffee factory branches in Egypt.

üìå Project Overview
Cofakortory is an imaginary industrial information system designed to measure, monitor, and reduce carbon emissions for a fictional coffee factory with 5 branches across Egypt. The system enables users to track emissions from coffee production, packaging, and distribution, generate carbon footprint reports, and implement reduction strategies to align with global climate goals.

üéØ Key Features
Role-Based Access Control:

Admins: Full system control, user management, and reduction plan oversight.

Managers: Generate tactical/strategic reports and analyze emissions trends.

Data Entry Officers: Input production, packaging, and distribution data.

Carbon Footprint Calculation:

Track emissions from waste, transportation, and production processes.
Calculate emissions using metrics like fuel efficiency, material quantities, and vehicle distances.

Reduction Plan Management:

Propose cost-effective strategies (e.g., waste reduction, energy efficiency).
Track implementation costs and projected annual profits.

Dynamic Reporting:
Generate time-bound reports for managers (e.g., monthly/quarterly emissions).

üè≠ Entities & Attributes
The system models the following entities:

Branch: Branch Name, Location, Employees
User: Role (Admin/Manager/Data Entry), Email, Security Level, Last Login
Coffee Packaging: Packaging Materials, Waste Generation, CO2 Emissions
Coffee Production: Raw Materials, Product Type, Production Quantities
Coffee Distribution: Transportation Type, Fuel Efficiency, Total Distance
Carbon Footprint Measurement: Start/End Dates, Emissions per Branch
Reduction Plan: Strategy, Costs, Projected Profits
